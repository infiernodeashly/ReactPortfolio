    "bio": "I am a Project Manager changing my career to a Website Developer. I started in the food retail and hospitality industries and moved my way into government contracting work as a security officer. From there, I obtained my B.A. in Communications and worked on various government contracts in a communication-related position. Shortly later, I obtained my M.S. in Computer Information Systems, and with my communications experience I successfully executed the position of Project Manager for building government-funded systems. However, I know my love lies in developing technology and, therefore, am making a career change in that direction. My technical training comes in the form of George Wasington University's Full-Stack Coding Bootcamp, Java Programming and Advanced Database Design and Development courses from Bellevue University, and web design and Macromedia courses from Northern Virginia Community College. As for experience, I developed a database and reports using MS Access Web Apps and SharePoint online to track proposal data for a cyber security training program, maintained and updated various program websties, and planned and perfomed Website Usability Testing, along with system internal and User Acceptance Testing.",
